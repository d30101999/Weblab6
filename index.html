        Peterhof or Petergof (Dutch/German for "Peter's Court"), known as Petrodvorets (Russian: Петродворец) from 1944 to 1992, is a municipal town within
        Petrodvortsovy District of the federal city of Saint Petersburg, on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland.
        The town is famous for it is a series of palaces and gardens known as the Peterhof Palace, laid out on the orders of Peter the Great, and sometimes called the "Russian Versailles",
        but also for the "Petrodvorets Watch Factory - Raketa", a 300-year-old Russian watch manufacture.
        The palace-ensemble along with the city center is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area was extensively damaged during World War II during occupation by Nazi Germany.
        Reconstruction efforts began almost immediately following the war, and they are still underway.
        Peterhof also hosts one of two campuses of Saint Petersburg State University.

        One of the most beautiful sights in St. Petersburg is this multicolored church designed in traditional medieval Russian style.
        Alexander III ordered its construction in 1883 on the site where his father had been assassinated two years prior.
        It took over 20 years for the church to be finally completed, partly because of budget and partly because the materials needed for its interior décor (which included 7,500 square meters of mosaics to cover the walls and ceilings)
        weren't that easy to come by.
        The church was seriously damaged during the Russian Revolution in 1917, then used as a morgue during WWII and as a potato warehouse right after. It took almost 30 years of restoration to get the building to its original splendor–
        but rather than reopening as a church, the structure is now a museum of mosaics.
